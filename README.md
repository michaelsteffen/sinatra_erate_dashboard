sinatra_erate_dashboard
=======================

Mark, Allison, Anne, any others -- the way github private repos work, you now have full access to this repo. This allows you to directly commit to branches or master.  But I think it will work best if instead you fork your own branch before making changes and then submit pull requests to incorporate them back into master.  Thanks!

The app is built with Sinatra & ActiveRecord, plus a fair bit of raw SQL for the dashboard queries.  The front end uses Twitter Bootstrap with very minimal custom css styling.  The basic app structure is a "Model-View-Presenter" approach, which is a derivative of the usual "Model-View-Controller" framework.  Googling around a little on these topics may help you make more sense of the code.
