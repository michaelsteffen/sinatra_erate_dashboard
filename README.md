sinatra_erate_dashboard
=======================

A proof-of-concept, simple dashboard for Funding Year 2014 E-Rate performance data, using weekly data dumps from USAC. Built with Sinatra and ActiveRecord plus a fair bit of raw SQL for the dashboard queries.  The front end is Twitter Bootstrap. Sample deployment on Heroku here: http://a00-sinatra-erate-dashboard.herokuapp.com/.
